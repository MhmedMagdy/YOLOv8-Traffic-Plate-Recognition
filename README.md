# YOLOv8 Real-Time License Plate Detection and OCR

ðŸš— **Real-Time License Plate Detection and Text Extraction using YOLOv8 and OCR for Traffic Monitoring** ðŸš“

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting car license plates in real-time traffic videos using the YOLOv8 object detection model, fine-tuned specifically for license plates. Additionally, it leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools to extract text from the detected plates in real time. This system can be useful for traffic monitoring, automated toll systems, and law enforcement.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Fine-tuned YOLOv8 model for accurate and efficient license plate detection.
- **OCR Integration**: Extracts text from detected plates in real-time using Tesseract OCR.
- **Traffic Video Support**: Processes live or recorded traffic video feeds.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable for different types of plates or regions.
